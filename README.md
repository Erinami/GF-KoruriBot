# GF-KoruriBot
Discord Bot - test of the API, and for role/community management.

Currently in very early stages, made an attempt to roll out the random card features asap so code is still pretty ugly.

Role management and server management tools will come soon, as well as some other random nifty features. Preferably a full-fledged search system too, but with the pain of parsing a text field rather than controlled queries the input that the bot takes would have to be very strict. 

Or maybe I could use natural language processing... perhaps I should take a course on that first? If anybody knows of some neat libraries for doing this that would be pretty cool. NaturalNode seems cool, but I don't think I have enough time to look into this right now - maybe over the summer?

Main priority is to get community features rolled out, and then move on to the front-end user facing card database.
